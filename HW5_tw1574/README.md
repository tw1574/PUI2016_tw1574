For this homework (and class) I was out of town, so could not work with anyone in-person. I referenced the work of Dana Karwas (dlk253@nyu.edu), Bailey Griswold (bg1672@nyu.edu), Christian O Rosado (cor215@nyu.edu), and Jonathan A Toy (jt2276@nyu.edu) for Assignments 1, 2, & 3. 


### Assignment 1: 

```
Test whether a gaussian model N($\mu$, $\sigma$) for the age distribution of citibike drivers is a sensible model, or if you can find a better fit with another distribution.

Use 2 tests: KS, AD, KL, chisq (even though we have not talked about it in detail yet) to do this.

Test at the Normal and a least one other distributions (e.g. Poisson, or Binomial, or Chisq, Lognormal.......)

No skeleton: you are on your own!

Extra credit: Divide your sample geographically: by Borrow + split Manhattan in an Uptown and a Downtown sample (use your discretion to do so, but ZIP code is a good idea) and see if you notice any differences in how the age distribution can be modeled.
```

### Assignment 2: 

```
You may know that it is estimated that women earn about 78% of men in the same job position. You will test if it is true on real income data, and turn your model into a prediction: if you get hired at a certain stipend as a men, what should you expect to make as a woman? Follow the skeleton notebook

Your notebook must:

have all celled filled in as indicated

properly organize the data

plot the scatter matrix

plot the data (female vs male income) as directed

do and plot a linear regression to the data, only Total Median Income and median income by category

compare the linear regressions

have predictions at the end of a salaty for a female, given the corresponding male salary
```

### Assignment 3: 

```
Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?
Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

Do American trust the president?
POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.

Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.
Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.

Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.
Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.
