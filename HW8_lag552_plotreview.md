#### Plot representing the Inmate Population vs Stabbing/Slashing Incidents in NYC Prisons, 2001-2010

## Review

### Clarity
The intent of the plot is pretty straight-forward showing a linear relationship between population and stabbing/slashing incidents.  The axises, axis titles, and title are all very clear.

A possible thought for improvement is a different visualization type to represent the data.  Possibly a cluster or not aggregating the data.  Also, including the time period.
 
### Aesthetic
The color selection for the graph seems appropriate, and provides a nice contrast to the background.  The best fit line is helpful to show the linear relationship.  

### Honesty
The plot is mostly honest, zoomed in based on the data, though that could contribute to a misleading view of the data.  Only other suggestion was mentioned above regarding incorporating the period.

### General Comments
Good, straight-forward visualization, but could be represented differently.
