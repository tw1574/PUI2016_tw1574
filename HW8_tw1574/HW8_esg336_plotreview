#### Plot representing the Number of Felonies per day in 2015.

## Review

### Clarity
The plot is easy to read; it doesnâ€™t appear ambiguous, misleading or present distractions.

It does not make use of unnecessary graphical effects and conveys a clear message.

A few possible improvements might be:

- Check some of the minor spelling errors
- Are there days missing?  Friday/Saturday/Sunday are missing
- The title is a bit duplicative.  Perhaps make it more descriptive.
 
### Aesthetic
The color selection for the graph seems appropriate, and provides a nice contrast to the background.  Also, the gray background and grid provide consistency and an ability to more easily read the graph.

### Honesty
The plot is mostly honest and gives a good representation of the numbers represented.  Only suggestion was mentioned above where it appears some of the days of the week are missing.

### General Comments
Good, straight-forward visualization.  One potential thought might be to look at an average versus a sum of the numbers.
