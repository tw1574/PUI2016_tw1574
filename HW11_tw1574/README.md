For this homework, I worked with Kelsey D Reid <kelsey.reid@nyu.edu>, William Xia <wbx200@nyu.edu>, Bailey Griswold <bg1672@nyu.edu>, Benjamin Joseph Alpert <bja282@nyu.edu>, Sofiya Elyukin <se1296@nyu.edu>, Marc Edward Toneatto <met414@nyu.edu>, Jonathan D Geis <jdg545@nyu.edu>, Scott Smith <ss4977@nyu.edu>

### Assignment 1:
CUSP identification through Geopandas
