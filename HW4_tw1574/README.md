## PUI2016_tw1574
## HW4
For this homework, I worked with Bailey Griswold (bg1672@nyu.edu), Dana Karwas (dlk253@nyu.edu), xinran (Celia) Yu (celiayu@nyu.edu), and Jonathan A Toy (jt2276@nyu.edu) on Assignments 3 & 4.  We all collaborated in our Friday working session, and we all contributed to the null hypotheses, python & pandas commands in the Jupyter notebook

### Assignment 1: Review your classmate's Citibike project proposal

```
1. check that at least one of these class-mates is not already in your group and contact me promptly if they both are! By lunch time tomorrow I want to do the necessary reassignments so that each of you is paired with a classmate so I need to know ASAP.

2. look in the classmate HW3_<netid> repo ASAP and identify their submission for the citibike project. If you cannot find it contact them immediately!

3. Fork their repository, and clone it (you did this in HW1, look at the instructions in the HW1 README if you need to refresh your memory)

4. Read it carefully (but do not modify the notebook)! You have to:

a. verify that their Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly

b. verify that the data supports the project: i.e. if the a data has the appropriate features (variables) to answer the question, and if the data was properly pre-processed to extract the needed values (there is some flexibility here since the test was not chosen yet)

c. Chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked. You can refer to the flowchart of statistical tests for this in the slides, or to the CSU cheat-sheet here, of Statistics in a Nutshell.

5. Write your comments, suggestions, and suggested statistical test, motivating your test choice, in a markdown named CitibikeReview_<netID>.md.

6. Submit a pull request to the original repository.

### Assignment 2: Literature choices of statistical tests

```
Choose two tests from the first table in A. Marengo CSU "When to use what test?" document, one in the top potrion of the chart (chi-sq, t-test, and the ANOVA family of tests) where you are looking for differences between groups, and one in the bottom portion where you are looking for relationships bewteen the dependent and independent variables (correlation, regression, path analysis).

Go to the main web page of the journal PLOS ONE and search for articles that use that test (DO NOT USE THE ARTICLE I USED FOR THE CLASS EXAMPLE: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062593).

Put the name of your tests (one by one) in the search (you can also use the advanced search) and choose a paper that uses the test you selected. Read the relevant portions of the paper (the abstract, and then a search for occurrences of the test name may be sufficient!) and identify what are the Dependent Variables (DV), Independent Variables (IV), and, if applicable, control variables (remember class 1 slides if you forgot), how many they are, and what type they are (categorical, continuous...).

Write out the number of DV, type of DV, number of IV, type of IV, number of control variables, kind of questions as a table in your README.md file, filling in the same fields as in the first table in the "When to use what test?" document.

This is a template for the table. To see how it is written clock on the Raw link to see this README.md in its raw unrendered format.

### Assignment 3: Reproduce the analysis of the Hard to Employ program in NY

```
Reproduce the analysis of the Hard to Employ programs for NY. You may want to read the relevant portion of the study to make sure you are not just workign mechanically (Chapter 2 of the original document).

Reproduce the results in cell 2 of Table 2.1 (Ever employed in a CEO transitional job), and cell 10 (Convicted of a felony). Fill in the cells of the scheleton notebook as you are asked to.

Turn in your version of the python notebook in the HW4_<netID> directory
```

### Assignment 4: Tests of correlation using the scipy package with citibike data

```
Use the following are 3 tests to assess correlation between 2 samples of citibike data:

Pearson’s test
Spearman’s test
K-S test
Follow along with the skeleton notebook citibikes_compare_distributions.ipynb.

Use: age of bikers for 2 genders. State your result in words in terms of the Null Hypothesis
```
