## HW6
For this homework, I worked either in-person or virtually with Dana Karwas (dlk253@nyu.edu), Bailey Griswold (bg1672@nyu.edu), "Xinran(Celia) Yu" <xy1002@nyu.edu>, Sofiya Elyukin <se1296@nyu.edu>, and Benjamin Joseph Alpert <bja282@nyu.edu> for Assignment 1. For Assignment 2, I collaborated with my group with whom I had worked on the original part of the project in week 3 - Christian O Rosado (cor215@nyu.edu), xinran (Celia) Yu (celiayu@nyu.edu), Jonathan A Toy (jt2276@nyu.edu), and Dana Karwas (dlk253@nyu.edu) 


### Assignment 1: Work from the skeleton notebook

```
https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2016_fb55/blob/master/HW6_fb55/building_nrg_instructions.ipynb with the inline instructions.

Turn in as a notebook, you can work in groups as usual, have a statement of the workbalance in the group as usual.
```

### Assignment 2: Finish the citibike mini-project and WRITE A SHORT REPORT ON IT WITH AUTHOREA (https://www.authorea.com/)

```
You should have made an authorea account last week. Submit by including the link to the authorea writeup in your HW6 repo readme. The writup should be short (less than 500 words). It should include plots, a link to the githubRepo work (possibly the notebook incorporated in the work) It needs to be in correct English. It needs the following sections:

- Abstract (short summary of the idea, the analysis, the result)
- Data (describe the data you used and very briefly what data wrengling was needed)
- Analysis (describe the analysis you did, which tests you used, why?)
- Result (description of the result and conclusion from the analysis)

Work with your group. All group members should be authors of the authorea writeup. Incorporate your classmate review suggestions.
```

# FBB feedback

I like that you all worked collaboratively in the authorea environments and left comments for each other. But the analysis is WRONG! your Null is consistent with the proportions in the data! See the cmments in the authorea paper and the updated notebook on xy1002 github. If this is not clear please come talk to me!
