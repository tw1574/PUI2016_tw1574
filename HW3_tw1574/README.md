For this homework, I worked with Christian O Rosado (cor215@nyu.edu), xinran (Celia) Yu (celiayu@nyu.edu), and Jonathan A Toy (jt2276@nyu.edu) on Assignment 2.  We all collaborated in our Friday working session, and we all contributed to the python and pandas commands in the file.

### Assignment 1: Write an ipython notebook that demonstrates visually in a data-driven way the Central Limit Theorem

```
GENERATE 100 samples of different sizes N (N>10 & N<2000) from each of 5 different distributions (500 samples in total),
all with the same population mean. Include a Normal, a Poisson, a Binomial, a Chi-Squared distribution, and 1 more of your choice.
For each sample plot the sample mean (dependent var.) against the sample size N (independent var.) (if you want you can do it with the sample standard deviation as well).
Describe the behavior you see in the plots in terms of the law of large numbers.
PLOT the distributions of all sample means (together for all distributions). Mandatory: as a histogram. Optional: in any other way you think is convincing
Extra Credit: FIT a gaussian to the distribution of means
```

### Assignment 2: Set up the work for data-driven inference based on CitiBike data. You should, even more than usual, work in groups for this!

```
Work on compute. Choose a citibikes dataset within the CUSP data facility (DF).

Fire off a Jupyter notebook with Jupyter Hub --here for Mac and Linux and here for Windows-- and switch to the Kernel PUI2016_Python2 or PUI2016_Python3 from the Jupyter dropdown menu under Kernels -> Change Kernel.

Write a Jupyter Notebook on compute. This will require you to use the JupyterHub (instructions here ). Write a notebook that:

States the question you want to ask, and formulates the Null and Alternative hypothesis (remember the confidence level!)

Use pandas to read in the CitiBike files, either from the DF, or locally, but you must be able to download them on the spot (so the TA can reproduce your work).
Display the top few rows of the DF in your notebook. This table must be rendered.
Display the reducted dataframe. This table must be rendered.
Plot your data distributions.
```

### Assignment 3: Finish z-test lab and turn it in as a notebook

```
I am looking for here is: seeing a good Null/alternative hypothesis statement and treatment, with a clear Null and Alternative spelled out AND written out as a formula, and a good interpretation of the Z value you obtain in terms of ability or inability to reject the Null Hypothesis. Here is the forumla

$ Z = \frac{\mu_{pop} - \mu_{sample}}{\sigma / \sqrt{N}} $

This is also in the slides attached (in a more readable format).

The chapter of Statistics In a Nutshell that covers these topics is called Inferential statistics. It is chapter 3 in the hard copies of the book in the CUSP library, but it was moved to chapter 7 in the online book version which is in the link. Same content more or less.
