####(1) What does the color ramp on the right side of the graph represent?  I'm sure it's minutes, but this should definitely be labeled.

(2) I think the title should be more explicit in terms of the geography this data is relevant for (Manhattan?  New York City?  The U.S.?) as well as what graph is actually representing.  Is this the average total commute time in minutes per day for various age groups?  Is this total commute time in minutes by day for various age groups.  I’m having trouble discerning exactly what the plot is telling me.  This could be remedied by:

(3) Inclusion of a caption.  I’m not sure the professor required the caption or not, but I think it would pretty useful give the somewhat complex assemblage of data you are presenting here.

I think stylistically your plot looks very good, and I think it has the right foundation, but with a few tweaks to help viewer better understand exactly what’s going on would really put it over the top.
