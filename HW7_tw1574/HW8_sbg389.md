#### Plot representing the Morning Rush Hour Commute time in minutes by age and hours.

## Review

### Clarity
The plot is easy to read; it doesnâ€™t appear ambiguous, misleading or present distractions.
It conveys a good amount of information (Three different dimensions) that is easy and fast to locate.
It does not make excessive use of graphical effects (The surface size and gradient is pleasant and contributes to the fast location of the information)
A possible improvement might be to clarify the period (is it number of minutes of commute per day? Per Week?)
Another minor suggestion will be to use different font sizes for the title, axis labels, etc. in order to bring more attention to the most relevant elements (such as title).
 
### Aesthetic
The color selection for the gradient seems appropriate: the different shades look unambiguous and are easy to relate to the scale values. 

### Honesty
No element on the plot appear to distort the reproduction of the data. The darker colors representing higher values are intuitive.

### General Comments
Good visualization, minor comments related to the clarity, a caption with the summary of the story might be helpful to understand the general context and guide the user on the exploration of the data.
