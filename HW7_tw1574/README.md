For this homework, I worked alone to complete the plot of existing data


### Assignment 1: Phase 1 - Any plot from previous data

```
Just one plot this week! Choose to plot anything you wish, from the data we used so far. Please make it a good plot.
Put though into the esthetic of the plot, how clearly the content is communicated, avoid clutter, avoid misleading elements, mind your choice of colors according ly to what was discussed in class.
```
